# NER_comp4211

This was a group project for Machine Learning course COMP4211 at HKUST, Spring 2025. The task was to build a model for classification of words into tags, aka **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, for the following kaggle competition: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/comp-4211-spring-25-project/overview]. 

We experimented with different models from the transformers library, mostly variations of BERT, to see how they performed on this task. The main metric was f1 score and the highest score was achieved by bert-large-cased on this task (84%). Folder project_notebooks contains main models that I fine-tuned for this project. Report discusses our results.
